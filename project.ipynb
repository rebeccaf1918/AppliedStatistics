    "A t test is a statistical test which is used to determine whether or not there is a significant diferrence between two samples. It does this by comparing the means of two groups and determining if the means are significantly different. It is particularly useful for determining if the differences in the means are due to chance or whetehr they are statistically significant.\n",
    "The t test was originally developed by [William Seely Gosset](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-guinness-brewery-invented-the-most-important-statistical-method-in/) who worked for the Guinness Brewing Company and developed the t test as part of his goal of measuring the quality of stout produced. He published his t test in 1908 under the psudynom 'Student' so as not to tip of competitors of his findings.\n",
    "The t test has since become one of the cornerstones of modern statistical analysis and is often used in hypothesis testing to determine whether a particular treatment or process has any actual effect on a group, e.g a control vs a treatment group. It is also often used to determine whether two groups are different from one another.  \n",
    "The t test is most commonly used when the data is normally distributed but the population variance is unknown.\n",
    "The t test looks at the means of two groups, and then calculates a t-statistic. This t statistic is used to determine if the null hypothesis is true or false. (The null hypothesis is that there is no significant differnce between the means of the two groups.)\n",
    "It then uses the resulting p-value to decide if the difference is statistically significant based on a chosen threshold (this threshold is often 0.05)\n",

    "There are 3 main types of t test:  \n",
    "One-sample t-test: Tests the mean of a single group to a known value or population mean.\n",
    "Two-sample t-test (Independent t-test): Tests the means of two independent, separate groups.\n",
